PTT Sequencer is a circuit that switch RF in the way that relays in the radio shack will never switch in the presence of RF (hot switch) preventing the deterioration of those equipments.
While other solutions can be take into account, using a small Arduino Nano to take care for timings on a PTT Sequencer is the most elegant solution.
If it were for me, the device would stand in my mind only but I made a promise to help a fellow ham and this is how this was born.
